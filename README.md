# Drone Flight Utilities

Small collection of Python scripts for interacting with Betaflight/MultiWii-compatible flight controllers over MSP.

## Contents
- `motor-pulse.py` — Improved motor pulsing script (sustained motor test, configurable PWM and duration).
- `motor-pulse-betaflight.py` — Alternate motor pulser.
- `diagnose-fc.py` — Helper script for diagnosing flight controller (FC) responses.
- `script-drone-betaflight-data.py` — Reads live Betaflight telemetry (attitude, IMU, battery, etc.).
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies.
- `chat.json` (archived) — Chat/agent history, moved to `archive/`.

## Quick Start
1. Create and activate a Python virtual environment. Example (PowerShell):

    ```powershell
    python -m venv .env
    & .\.env\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Remove propellers and check wiring and battery before running motor tests.

3. Run the motor pulser (adjust `COM_PORT`, `MOTOR_VALUE`, `SPIN_DURATION` inside the script as needed):

    ```powershell
    & .\.env\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    python .\motor-pulse.py
    ```

## Additional Notes
### `diagnose-fc.py`
This script is designed to help diagnose issues with flight controllers. It can be used to:
- Verify MSP communication.
- Check for valid responses from the FC.
- Debug telemetry data streams.

### `script-drone-betaflight-data.py`
This script reads live telemetry data from a Betaflight-compatible flight controller. It provides real-time insights into:
- Attitude (roll, pitch, yaw).
- IMU data (accelerometer, gyroscope).
- Battery status and voltage.

### Archived Files
- `chat.json`: This file contained chat/agent history and is not required for running the project. It has been moved to the `archive/` directory to keep the workspace clean.

## Safety
- Always remove propellers before testing motors.
- Keep `MOTOR_VALUE` conservative at first (try +50 increments).
- Use `Ctrl+C` to abort immediately.

## Why Files Were Archived
- Non-essential files like `chat.json` were archived to maintain a clean workspace. If you want more cleanup (remove other files or reorganize scripts), let me know which files to archive or delete.
